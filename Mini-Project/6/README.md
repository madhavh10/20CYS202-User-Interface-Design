20CYS202  - User Interface Design - Flight Ticket Booking System <br>
We have explored a lot many flight systems like Emirates, Qatar airways, Air India etc... To get an idea on how the outline of a basic flight booking system looks like.
A Flight ticket booking system has so many processes like 
1) Choosing a destination
2) Check the availability of the seats
3) Book tickets
4) Payment
5) Cancel Tickets and refund process

Basically when we create a website or a user interface for the users, there are three steps that we used to approach:
1. User analysis.
2. System prototyping.
3. Interface evaluation

What we actually want is to check how users see and interact with the software. In this Flight management system, we have to make buttons clearer and visible. Also we want to display the prices prominently because it is one of the main criteria on which most visitors make their choice. We want to bring in more information about the destinations for the visitors to explore and choose.
