20CYS202  - User Interface Design - Flight Ticket Booking System
We have explored a lot many flight systems like Emirates, Qatar airways, Air India etc... To get an idea on how the outline of a basic flight booking system looks like.
A Flight ticket booking system has so many processes like 
1) Choosing a destination
2) Check the availability of the seats
3) Book tickets
4) Payment
5) Cancel Tickets and refund process
Basically when we create a website or a user interface for the users, there are three steps that we used to approach:
1. User analysis.
2. System prototyping.
3. Interface evaluation
